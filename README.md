Inspiration
As people who go to the gym, we thought of creating an app that would help people who are starters or want to have a specific focus with their workouts and stay on track. Everyone has a hard time figuring out which workout set or exercises are better for their goal and how to adapt their diet at the same time, so our app helps users to narrow down te options that would fit their goal best. 

What it does
The interface asks the user for their goal which can be bulking or shredding and the intensity level of the workout. Based on that information, a workout set is provided. The application can also recommend specific diets based on your goal, so that you not only stay on track with exercises but a focused diet that will healp you achieve your goal, either it be bulking or shredding. The diet is based on what your goal is and it can be vegan, diet, and high protein.

Challenges we ran into
Figuring out the full potential of s(CASP) was challenging cause we didn't have experience with the different functions the language allowed us to use, for example: findall and random_member. It was pretty challenging to find out the recursive logic to address the workouts as lists and be able to add up each exercise's time while also putting them together according to the filter of user goal. Recommending the workout interface had issues in displaying the correct exercise list because the logic of arguments and print statements was confusing since the functions we created had multiple arguments and connecting the user input with the arguments would get information lost in the way.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing our app brought a lot of knowledge about prolog, s(CASP), and AI reasoning. As begginers in the AI world we developed not only the app, but out potential as developers. Our project had a lot of challenges but we worked well as a team, hekping each other and researching topics that the others wouldn't understand as much. We could learn how each piece of the project worked and how the person taking care of that part worked through the problems, as well as being open to different styles of coding for each of us and different struggles.
