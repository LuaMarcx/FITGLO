# FITGLO
## HackReason 2025 Health Personal Assistant
### Inspiration
As people who go to the gym, we decided to create an app that would help people who are beginners or want to have a specific focus on their workouts and stay on track. Everyone has difficulty figuring out which workout set or exercises are better for their goal and how to adapt their diet simultaneously. Therefore, our app helps users narrow down the options that best fit their goals.

### What it does
The interface asks the user for their goal, which can be bulking or shredding, and the workout's intensity level. Based on that information, a workout set is generated for the user. The application can also recommend specific diets based on your goal. Thus, you stay on track with exercises and have a focused diet to help you achieve your goal, whether bulking or shredding. The diet is based on your goal and can be vegan, diet, and high protein.

### How we built it
The specific exercise, intensity, and focus goal (shred or bulk) are predefined, and the recipes are used to recommend a user's diet. The program uses programming logic (prolog) and s(CASP) to simulate the reasoning of how a person would recommend a workout set and a diet based on someone else's needs.

### Challenges we ran into
Figuring out the full potential of s(CASP) was challenging because we didn't have experience with the different functions the language allowed us to use, for example: findall and random_member. It was challenging to find out the recursive logic to address the workouts as lists and be able to add up each exercise's time while also putting them together according to the filter of the user goal. Recommending the workout interface had issues in displaying the correct exercise list because the logic of arguments and print statements were confusing since the functions we created had multiple arguments, and connecting the user input with the arguments would get information lost in the way.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing our app brought a lot of knowledge about prolog, s(CASP) and AI reasoning. As beginners in the AI world, we developed the app and our potential as developers. Our project had a lot of challenges, but we worked well as a team, helping each other and researching topics that the others wouldn't understand as much. We are proud that we could build a functional app that can help people quickly, even if they do not know AI.

### What we learned
Looking at each portion made by each team member, we learned the different ways prolog could be incorporated as we were going and how to fix each other's issues. Having the opportunity to work with different people also brought different perspectives on how to create conditions and whether to interact with the user or not. Being new to the language allowed us to learn while being exposed to the different coding styles each of us had; when putting it all together, we could see the differences and learn from them.

### What's next for FITGLO
Since FitFLO is a health assistant, future implementations would include a period tracker with journaling so that users can write about their progress, motivational reminders to keep up with the plan, a timer while the exercise is being executed, and videos demonstrating it. The app would also have a more interactive design using a front-end base.
